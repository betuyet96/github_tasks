    <h1> Hanoi - The capital city of Vietnam</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <div class ="intro">
        <p id="p0">
            Hanoi, located on the banks of the Red River, is one of the most ancient capitals in the world, 
            where travellers can find well-preserved colonial buildings, ancient pagodas, and unique museums
             within the city centre. A great place to explore on foot, this French-colonial city is also known 
             for its delectable cuisine, vibrant nightlife, silks and handicrafts, as well as a multi-cultural 
             community that’s made up of Chinese, French and Russian influences. 
             <br />
             Meanwhile, its tranquil countryside is a short drive away, featuring lush parks, verdant mountains, and traditional villages, 
              and not forgetting, the iconic Ha Long Bay. If you’re a first-time visitor to the Vietnamese capital, 
              our Hanoi travel guide has everything you need to know for a fulfilling holiday, including the best accommodation,
               restaurants, attractions, shopping, and detailed information on the local culture, currency, climate, and  transport options.

        <p id="p1">
            The Imperial Citadel of Thang Long is an intriguing relic of Vietnam’s history and, 
            signifying its historical and cultural importance, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
            Standing 40 metres high, the central flag tower is the most recognizable feature of the 
            Imperial Citadel and is often used as a symbol of Hanoi. This was the centre of ancient 
            Hanoi and served as the political centre for eight centuries. Located in Ba Dinh, 
            the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long is close to many other tourist attractions.

            <h3 id="h3">2. Water Puppet Theatre</h3>
            <img src="2.jpg" alt ="Water Puppet Theatre"/>
            <p id="p2">
                The ancient art form of water puppetry has a long association with Hanoi and there 
                are several theatres where guests can enjoy this uniquely Vietnamese take on Asia’s 
                puppet tradition. The original – and widely regarded as the best – theatre in town 
                is the Thang Long Puppet Theatre. Puppets dance and slide elegantly over the liquid stage, 
                controlled by a whole troupe of puppet masters hiding behind a screen. Most shows also 
                feature the famous Legend of the Restored Sword of King Le which tells the tale of 
                Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise.
